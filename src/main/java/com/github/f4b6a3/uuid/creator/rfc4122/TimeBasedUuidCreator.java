	 * 
	 * Determine the values for the UTC-based timestamp and clock sequence to be
	 * used in the UUID, as described in Section 4.2.1.
	 * 
	 * For the purposes of this algorithm, consider the timestamp to be a 60-bit
	 * unsigned integer and the clock sequence to be a 14-bit unsigned integer.
	 * Sequentially number the bits in a field, starting with zero for the least
	 * significant bit.
	 * 
	 * "Set the time_low field equal to the least significant 32 bits (bits zero
	 * through 31) of the timestamp in the same order of significance.
	 * 
	 * Set the time_mid field equal to bits 32 through 47 from the timestamp in the
	 * same order of significance.
	 * 
	 * Set the 12 least significant bits (bits zero through 11) of the
	 * time_hi_and_version field equal to bits 48 through 59 from the timestamp in
	 * the same order of significance.
	 * 
	 * Set the four most significant bits (bits 12 through 15) of the
	 * time_hi_and_version field to the 4-bit version number corresponding to the
	 * UUID version being created, as shown in the table above."
