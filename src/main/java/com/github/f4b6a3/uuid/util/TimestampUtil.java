	 * (4) A high resolution timestamp can be simulated by keeping a count of
	 * the number of UUIDs that have been generated with the same value of the
	 * system time, and using it to construct the low order bits of the
	 * timestamp. The count will range between zero and the number of
	 * 100-nanosecond intervals per system time interval.
