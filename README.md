UUID Creator
======================================================

A Java library for generating and handling RFC-4122 UUIDs.

#### RFC-4122 UUIDs:

* __Version 1__: Time-based;
* __Version 2__: DCE Security;
* __Version 3__: Name-based (MD5);
* __Version 4__: Random-based;
* __Version 5__: Name-based (SHA1);
* __Version 6__: Time-ordered (proposed).

#### Non-standard GUIDs:

* __COMB GUID__: a GUID that combines random bits with the creation time (suffix);
* __Alternate COMB GUID__: a GUID that combines the creation time (prefix) with random bits.

How to Use
------------------------------------------------------

### No time to read

If you just want a _random_ UUID, which is the most common case, use this single line of code:

```java
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getRandomBased();
```

Or if you want a UUID that is _based on_ creation time, use this line of code:

```java
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeBased();
```

Or if you want a UUID that is _ordered by_ creation time, use this line:

```java
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeOrdered();
```

### Maven dependency

Add these lines to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.f4b6a3/uuid-creator -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.f4b6a3</groupId>
  <artifactId>uuid-creator</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
See more options in [maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.f4b6a3/uuid-creator) and [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.f4b6a3/uuid-creator).

### Version 1: Time-based

The Time-based UUID has a timestamp and may have a hardware address.

The versions 1 and 6 use the same basic algorithm: both are based on date and time. The only difference is that the version 1 changes the timestamp byte order in a special layout.

```java
// Time-based
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeBased();
```

```java
// Time-based with hardware address
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeBasedWithMac();
```

Examples of time-based UUID:

```text

```

### Version 2: DCE Security

The DCE Security is a time-based UUID that also has a local domain and a local identifier.

```java
// DCE Security
UuidLocalDomain localDomain = UuidLocalDomain.LOCAL_DOMAIN_PERSON;
int localIdentifier = 1701;
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getDceSecurity(localDomain, localIdentifier);
```

```java
// DCE Security with hardware address
UuidLocalDomain localDomain = UuidLocalDomain.LOCAL_DOMAIN_GROUP;
int localIdentifier = 1984;
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getDceSecurityWithMac(localDomain, localIdentifier);
```

### Version 3: Name-based (MD5)

The version 3 UUID is generated by a MD5 hash algorithm.

```java
// Name-based MD5
String name = "https://github.com/";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5(name);
```

```java
// Name-based MD5 using a name space
UuidNamespace namespace = UuidNamespace.NAMESPACE_URL;
String name = "https://github.com/";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5(namespace, name);
```

### Version 4: Random-based

The Random UUID is a simple random array of 16 bytes. 

The default random generator is `SecureRandom`.

```java
// Random using the default SecureRandom generator
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getRandomBased();
```

```java
// Random using the fast Xorshift128Plus generator
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getFastRandomBased();
```

Examples of random-based UUID:

```

### Version 5: Name-based (SHA-1)

The version 5 UUID is generated by a SHA-1 hash algorithm.


```java
// Name-based SHA-1
String name = "https://github.com/";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedSha1(name);
```

```java
// Name-based SHA-1 using a name space
UuidNamespace namespace = UuidNamespace.NAMESPACE_URL;
String name = "https://github.com/";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedSha1(namespace, name);
```

### Version 6: Time-ordered (proposed)

The Time-ordered UUID has a timestamp and may have a hardware address. 

The timestamp bits are kept in the original order, unlike the time-based UUID.

```java
// Time-ordered
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeOrdered();
```

```java
// Time-ordered with hardware address
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getTimeOrderedWithMac();
```

Examples of time-ordered UUID:

```text

### COMB GUID (non-standard)

The COMB GUID<sup>[7]</sup> is a modified random-based UUID that replaces the LAST 6 bytes with Unix epoch milliseconds.

The creation time is a SUFFIX after the random bytes.

```java
// COMB GUID
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getCombGuid();
```

Examples of COMB GUID:

```text

### Alternate COMB GUID (non-standard)

The Alternate COMB GUID is a modified random-based UUID that replaces the FIRST 6 bytes with Unix epoch milliseconds.

The creation time is a PREFIX before the random bytes.

```java
// COMB GUID
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getAltCombGuid();
```

Examples of COMB GUID:

System properties and environment variables
------------------------------------------------------

### Node identifier

The `nodeid` property is used by the `DefaultNodeIdentifierStrategy`. If this property or variable exists, its value is returned. Otherwise, a random value is returned. In the default strategy the `nodeid` property is a *preferred value* for the node identifier, that is, it overrides the random value generated by the node identifier strategy. It may be useful if you want to identify each single machine by yourself, instead of allowing the algorithm do it for you. It accepts 12 hexadecimal chars.

The simplest way to avoid collisions is to ensure that each generator has its own node identifier.

* Using system property:

```bash
// append to VM arguments
-Duuidcreator.nodeid="c0da06157723"
```

* Using environment variable:

```bash
// append to /etc/environment or ~/.profile
export UUIDCREATOR_NODEID="c0da06157723"
```

Implementation
------------------------------------------------------

### Format

The canonical format has 5 groups separated by dashes.

```
Canonical format

 00000000-0000-v000-m000-000000000000
|1-------|2---|3---|4---|5-----------|

1: 8 chars
2: 4 chars
3: 4 chars
4: 4 chars
5: 12 chars

v: version number
m: variant number (sharing bits with the clock-sequence)
```

### Representation

The `java.util.UUID`[<sup>&#x2197;</sup>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html) class represents a UUID with two `long` fields, called most significant bits (MSB) and least significant bits (LSB).

```
Representation in java.util.UUID

 00000000-0000-v000-m000-000000000000
|msb---------------|lsb--------------|

msb: Most Significant Bits
lsb: Least Significant Bits

v: version number
m: variant number (sharing bits with clock-sequence)
```

###  Time-based

The Time-based UUID has three main parts: timestamp, clock-sequence and node identifier.

```
Time-based UUID structure

 00000000-0000-v000-m000-000000000000
|1-----------------|2---|3-----------|

1: timestamp
2: clock-sequence
3: node identifier
```

#### Timestamp

The timestamp is a value that represents date and time. It has 4 subparts: low timestamp, middle timestamp, high timestamp and version number.

```
Standard timestamp arrangement

 00000000-0000-v000-m000-000000000000
|1-------|2---||3--|

1: timestamp low      *
2: timestamp mid     ***
3: timestamp high   *****
```

In the version 1 UUID the timestamp bytes are rearranged so that the highest bits are put in the end of the array of bits and the lowest ones in the beginning. The standard _timestamp resolution_ is 1 second divided by 10,000,000. The timestamp is the amount of 100 nanoseconds intervals since 1582-10-15. Since the timestamp has 60 bits (unsigned), the greatest date and time that can be represented is 5236-03-31T21:21:00.684Z.

In this implementation, the timestamp has milliseconds accuracy, that is, it uses `System.currentTimeMillis()`[<sup>&#x2197;</sup>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()) to get the current milliseconds. An internal _counter_ is used to _simulate_ the standard timestamp resolution of 10 million intervals per second.

You can create any strategy that implements the `TimestampStrategy` in the case that none of the strategies provided suffices.

##### Counter

The counter range is from 0 to 9,999. Every time a request is made at the same millisecond, the counter is increased by 1. Each counter value corresponds to a 100 nanosecond interval. The timestamp is calculated with this formula: MILLISECONDS * 10,000 + COUNTER. 

The timestamp counter is not instantiated with ZERO, but with a random number between 0 and 255. The 8 least significant bits of the counter are random. Every time a new counter value is required, this number is incremented by 1. When the limit of 9,999 is reached within the same interval, the counter is restarted to ZERO and an exception is raised. The first counter value for the next interval is the least 8 significant bits of the previous counter value.

##### Overrun exception

The overrun exception is thrown when too many requests are made within the same millisecond interval. If the timestamp counter reaches the maximum of 10,000 (0 to 9,999), it is restarted to ZERO and an exception is thrown to the developer decide how to handle it.

The exception is raised to comply the RFC-4122, that requires:

```text
   If a system overruns the generator by requesting too many UUIDs
   within a single system time interval, the UUID service MUST either
   return an error, or stall the UUID generator until the system clock
   catches up.
```

#### Clock sequence

The clock sequence helps to avoid duplicates. It comes in when the system clock is backwards or when the node identifier changes. It also expands the amount of UUIDs that can be created at the same millisecond.

The first bits of the clock sequence are multiplexed with the variant number of the RFC-4122. Because of that, it has a range from 0 to 16383 (0x0000 to 0x3FFF). This value is increased by 1 if more than one request is made by the system at the same timestamp or if the timestamp is backwards. In other words, it acts like a counter that is incremented whenever the timestamp repeats or may be repeated.

In the `DefaultClockSequenceStrategy` each generator on the same JVM receives a unique clock sequence value. This local uniqueness is managed by the class `ClockSequenceController`.

You can create any strategy that implements the `ClockSequenceStrategy` in the case that none of the strategies are good for you.

#### Node identifier

The node identifier is an IEEE 802 MAC address, usually the host machine address. But if no address is available or if the usage of MAC address is not desired, the standard allows the usage of a random generated value. In this library the default behavior is to use a random node identifier generated by a secure random generator.

It's also possible to use a _preferred node identifier_ by setting a system property or environment variable. The system property is `uuidcreator.nodeid` and the environment variable is `UUIDCREATOR_NODEID`. All UUIDs created on a machine will use the value present in the property or variable.

The simplest way to avoid collisions is to ensure that each generator has its own node identifier.

You can also create your own strategy that implements the `NodeIdentifierStrategy`.

##### Hardware address

The hardware address node identifier is the MAC address associated with the host name. If that MAC address can't be found, it uses the first MAC address that is up and running. If no MAC is found, a random number is used.

### Time-ordered

The Time-ordered UUID inherits the same characteristics of the time-based UUID. The only difference is that the timestamp bits are not rearranged as the Time-based UUID does. <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[5]</sup>

```
Time-ordered timestamp arrangement

 00000000-0000-v000-m000-000000000000
|1-------|2---||3--|

1: timestamp high   *****
2: timestamp mid     ***
3: timestamp low      *
```

#### Time-based vs Time-ordered

The RFC-4122 splits the timestamp bits into three parts: high, middle, and low. Then it reverses the order of these three parts to create a time-based UUID. The reason for this layout is not documented in the RFC-4122.

In the time-ordered, the timestamp bits are kept in the original layout. See the example below.

Instant:

```
 2019-09-22T17:52:55.033Z
```

Instant's timestamp in hexadecimal:

```
 01e9dd61ce117e90
```

Timestamp split into high, middle and low bits:

```
 _1e9 dd61 ce117e90
 _hhh mmmm llllllll

h: high bits
m: middle bits
l: low bit
_: placeholder for version bits
```

Timestamp in time-based layout (version 1):

```
 ce117e90-dd61-11e9-8080-39d701ba2e7c
 llllllll-mmmm-vhhh-ssss-nnnnnnnnnnnn

l: low bits
m: middle bits
h: high bits
v: version
s: clock sequence bits
n: node id bits
```

Timestamp in time-ordered layout (version 6):

```
 1e9dd61c-e117-0e90-8080-39d701ba2e7c
 hhhmmmml-llll-vlll-ssss-nnnnnnnnnnnn

l: low bits
m: middle bits
h: high bits
v: version
s: clock sequence bits
n: node id bits
```


###  DCE Security

The DCE Security UUID inherits the same characteristics of the time-based UUID. The RFC-4122 doesn't describe the algorithm for generating this kind of UUID. These instructions are in the document "DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services".<sup>[6]</sup>

The difference is that it also contains information of local domain and local identifier. A half of the timestamp is replaced by a local identifier number. And half of the clock sequence is replaced by a local domain number.

### Name-based

There are two types of name-based UUIDs: MD5 and SHA-1. The MD5 is registered as version 3. And the SHA-1 is registered as version 5.

Two arguments are needed to generate a name-based UUID: a name space and a name.

The name space is an optional UUID argument.

The name argument may be a string or a byte array.

### Random

The random-based factory uses `java.security.SecureRandom`[<sup>&#x2197;</sup>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html) to get 'cryptographic quality random' numbers as the standard requires.

If the default `SecureRandom` is not desired, any instance of `java.util.Random` can be passed as parameter to the factory.

Fluent interface
------------------------------------------------------

The UUID factories are configurable via [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) methods. This section lists a lot of examples for each UUID version.

```java

// without name space
String name = "Paul Smith";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5Creator()
    .create(name);

// with a name space
UuidNamespace namespace = UuidNamespace.NAMESPACE_URL;
String name = "www.github.com";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5Creator()
    .withNamespace(namespace)
    .create(name);

// with a CUSTOM name space
// In this example, the category "products/books" is transformed into a custom namespace
UUID customNamespace = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5("products/books")
String name = "War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy";
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getNameBasedMd5Creator()
    .withNamespace(customNamespace)
    .create(name);

```

#### Random-based

```java

// with java random generator (java.util.Random)
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getRandomBasedCreator()
    .withRandomGenerator(new Random())
    .create();

// with fast random generator (Xorshift128Plus)
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getRandomBasedCreator()
    .withFastRandomGenerator()
    .create();

```

#### COMB GUID

All the examples in this subsection are also valid for Alternate COMB GUIDs.

```java

// with java random generator (java.util.Random)
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getCombCreator()
    .withRandomGenerator(new Random())
    .create();

// with fast random generator (Xorshift128Plus)
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getCombCreator()
    .withFastRandomGenerator()
    .create();

```

#### DCE Security

```java

// with fixed local domain (POSIX User ID)
UuidLocalDomain localDomain = UuidLocalDomain.LOCAL_DOMAIN_PERSON;
int localIdentifier = 1701;
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getDceSecurityCreator()
    .withLocalDomain(localDomain)
    .create(localIdentifier);
    
// with fixed CUSTOM local domain
byte customLocalDomain = (byte) 54;
int localIdentifier = 1492;
UUID uuid = UuidCreator.getDceSecurityCreator()
    .withLocalDomain(customLocalDomain)
    .create(localIdentifier);

```

These external generators are used for comparison:

- com.eaio.uuid.UUID (for time-based UUID);
- java.util.UUID (for random UUID).

Benchmarks executed in a PC with Ubuntu 20.04, JVM 11.0.7, CPU Intel i5-3330 and 8GB RAM.

You can find the benchmark source code at [uuid-creator-benchmark](https://github.com/fabiolimace/uuid-creator-benchmark).

(*) The UUID generated by EAIO is not an instance of `java.util.UUID`.
